# ShortestPath

This started as a shortest path programming assignment but the requirements changed so I'll leave the graph visualizer here and move on to a different project.

This application includes a graph data structure and some Java Swing components for visualing the graph. The appearance of the graph can be changed by clicking and dragging the vertices around.
